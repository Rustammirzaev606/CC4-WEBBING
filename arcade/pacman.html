            <p>Pac-Man is a Japanese arcade game released in 1980 by Namco and published in North America by Midway. Bandai Namco have released numerous sequels and spin-offs, many of which have also been remade on multiple platforms, including home consoles and handheld devices. The first sequels were primarily released in arcades, while later titles were released on video game consoles.</p>

        <p>The player controls Pac-Man through a maze of various dots, known as Pac-Dots, as well as four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal of the game is to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage in order to proceed to the next one. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends.</p>

          <br><hr>
          <p>Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to consume the ghosts and earn bonus points. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again</p>

          <hr>
          <p>The enemies are known as "monsters" and "ghosts".  Red enemy chases Pac-Man, and the pink enemy aims for a position in front of Pac-Man's mouth.  The blue enemy sometimes heads towards Pac-Man and other times away. The orange enemy's behavior is random, in actuality it alternates from behaving like the red enemy when at some distance from Pac-Man and aiming towards the lower-left corner of the maze whenever it gets too close to him.</p>
